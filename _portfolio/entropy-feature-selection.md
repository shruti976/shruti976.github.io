excerpt: >
A robust RL model that selects features using entropy-based metrics, improving policy stability in noisy environments.

**Summary**: Developed a custom reinforcement learning pipeline for BipedalWalker and LunarLander.
Achieved 95%+ accuracy with entropy-driven sensor filtering to suppress noisy features in real time.
Demonstrated shielded policy learning under synthetic Gaussian noise.

**Highlights**:
- Outperformed KL Divergence and Joint Entropy baselines.
- Evaluated robustness under adversarial perturbations.
